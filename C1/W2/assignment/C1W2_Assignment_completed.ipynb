        "\n",
        "Write an MNIST classifier that trains to 99% accuracy or above, and does it without a fixed number of epochs -- i.e. you should stop training once you reach that level of accuracy. In the lecture you saw how this was done for the loss but here you will be using accuracy instead.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some notes:\n",
        "1. Given the architecture of the net, it should succeed in less than 10 epochs.\n",
        "2. When it reaches 99% or greater it should print out the string \"Reached 99% accuracy so cancelling training!\" and stop training.\n",
        "3. If you add any additional variables, make sure you use the same names as the ones used in the class. This is important for the function signatures (the parameters and names) of the callbacks."
